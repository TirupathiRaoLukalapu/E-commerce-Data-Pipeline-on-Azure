# Real-Time-Data-Streaming-Pipeline
# 🛰️ Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline

This project demonstrates a real-time data streaming pipeline for processing financial transactions using **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Spark**, **AWS**, and **Snowflake**. It is designed to simulate and process large volumes of streaming data, perform real-time transformations, and store insights for analysis.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

In financial systems, it's critical to process transaction data in real-time to detect anomalies, prevent fraud, and generate timely insights. This pipeline is built to:

- Ingest high-volume transactions
- Apply fraud detection logic in real time
- Store clean data for downstream analytics
- Trigger alerts for suspicious activity

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Tool / Technology     | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Apache Kafka**      | Message broker for streaming transactions    |
| **Apache Spark**      | Stream processing & transformation           |
| **Python**            | Fraud rule engine and orchestration scripts  |
| **Snowflake**         | Cloud data warehouse for analytics           |
| **AWS S3**            | Intermediate data storage for Snowpipe       |
| **Azure Logic Apps**  | Real-time alerting and notifications         |

## 🏗️ Key Features

- Processes up to **300,000+ transactions/day**
- Applies **risk-based fraud rules** in Python
- Reduces fraud detection time by **25%**
- Enables near **real-time monitoring** and alerting
- Handles **over 50 GB/day** of streaming data

## 🧪 How to Run (Local Setup)

1. **Start Kafka locally**
   ```bash
   bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
   bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

2.Run Kafka producer
bash
python kafka_producer/stream_transactions.py
Start Spark streaming

3.bash
spark-submit spark_streaming/process_stream.py
Monitor output

4.
  =>Alerts triggered by Azure Logic Apps
  =>Cleaned data pushed to Snowflake via Snowpipe
